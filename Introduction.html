				<h5>The aim of the project is to create a Doctor-Patient  handling website.</h5> 
				<h5>It will help doctors in their work and will always help patients to book doctor
				 appointments and view medical progress.</h5>
				<h5> This website allows doctor to manage their booking-slot online.</h5>
				<h5> Patients are allowed to book empty slots online, and those slots are reserved in their name.</h5> 
				<h5>This website manages the appointment data for multiple doctors of various date and times. </h5>
				<h5>Each time  a user visit a doctor his/her medical entry stored in the  database by doctors.</h5>
				<h5> Next time a user  logs in he may view his/her entire medical history as and when needed.</h5> 
				<h5>At the same time a doctor may view patients previews medical history, while the patient visits him. </h5>
				<h5>This is a web-based application that overcomes the issue of  managing and  booking appointments 
				according to userâ€™s choice and demands.</h5>
				<h5> The task sometimes become very tedious for the compounder
				 or doctor himself in manually allotting appointments for the users as per their availability. </h5>
                <h5>Hence , this project offers an effective solution where users can view various booking-slots available 
                and select the preferred date and time.</h5>
                <h5>This website helps to reduce the waiting time of patient and user can select
                 the appointment time according to his preference.</h5>
